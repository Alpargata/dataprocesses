We have choose **climate change** as topic. We think this is one of the most important problems in our society, and as young people we are very concerned about it. We think that technology and specially data science can be very useful to identify the causes and reduce global warming. 

It is expectable that many people and organizations are working with data to address this issue. We can find some examples:
- [__Using data to increase the production of renewable energy__](https://deepmind.com/blog/article/machine-learning-can-boost-value-wind-energy): Renewable energy help combat climate change, but many of them have not reached their full potential. DeepMind and Google has been applying machine learning algorithms to increase the productivity of wind farms in US (predicing wind power output 36 hours ahead of actual generation).
- [__Protecting the rainforests__](https://rfcx.org/): Rainforest Connection is a not-for-profit organization. They used old mobile phones, equipped with solar panels and placed in the branches of trees where they listen for sounds of logging trucks and chainsaws. The detection model behind this is driven by TensorFlow.
- [__Cleaning Mexico City’s air with transformational climate policies through big data pattern analysis in traffic & social mobility__](http://www.dataforclimateaction.org/meet-the-winners/): Mexico City is the most congested city in the world. Traffic data from Waze, data from EPA MOVES-Mexico, and Google Places’ Popular Times are used to optimize transportation and reduce CO2 emissions by 3.4%.
