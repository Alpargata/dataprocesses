# Domain of interest
Our topic of interest is **climate change** and **global warming**.

## Why are we interested?
We think this climate change is one of the most important problems in our society; in the present and near future. As young people, we are very concerned about it. We think that technology and specially data science can be very useful to identify the causes, the consequences and reduce global warming. As this is a wide topic, there are a lot of public and varied data available in the internet that we can explore: global temperatures, CO2 emissions, biodiversity, energy production, mobility, etc. Due to all this, we think that it is a really interesting domain to tackle with this project.

## Examples of data driven projects
It is expectable that many people and organizations are working with data to address this issue. We can find some examples:
- [__Using data to increase the production of renewable energy__](https://deepmind.com/blog/article/machine-learning-can-boost-value-wind-energy): Renewable energy help combat climate change, but many of them have not reached their full potential. DeepMind and Google has been applying machine learning algorithms to increase the productivity of wind farms in US (predicing wind power output 36 hours ahead of actual generation).
- [__Protecting the rainforests__](https://rfcx.org/): Rainforest Connection is a not-for-profit organization. They used old mobile phones, equipped with solar panels and placed in the branches of trees where they listen for sounds of logging trucks and chainsaws. The detection model behind this is driven by TensorFlow.
- [__Cleaning Mexico City’s air with transformational climate policies through big data pattern analysis in traffic & social mobility__](http://www.dataforclimateaction.org/meet-the-winners/): Mexico City is the most congested city in the world. Traffic data from Waze, data from EPA MOVES-Mexico, and Google Places’ Popular Times are used to optimize transportation and reduce CO2 emissions by 3.4%.

## Data driven questions we hope to answer
1. Is the climate change affecting all areas of the Earth equally, or are there some regions suffering more?
2. What was (in terms of climate change) the 'worst year' for our planet? (more polluted year, higher temperature...)
3. What are the countries that pollute the most?
